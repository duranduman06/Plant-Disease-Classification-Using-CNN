# Plant Disease Detection with CNN

This project aims to develop a deep learning model to automatically detect diseases using potato plant data from a dataset containing many plant species. 

The project analyzes images of plant leaves using deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

The model will be able to learn and detect healthy potato plants as well as images containing symptoms of common potato diseases.


## Selected Dataset 
- Dataset name: New Plant Disease Dataset 

- Source: Kaggle

- Plant used: Potato


This dataset consists of approximately 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased plant leaves, divided into 38 different classes.

For the project, only images containing potato diseases were used. 

The potato data consists of three classes: "potato early blight", "late blight" and "healthy". 

To use these diseases, I divided the dataset into 5632 train, 1152 validation and 288 test data. (Validation data was split 80/20 and test data was obtained.)
